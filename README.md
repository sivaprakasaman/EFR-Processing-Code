# EFR Processing - Andrew Sivaprakasam, Summer 2019

The following scripts/methods were designed to calculate and analyze Phase Locking Values (PLVs) and spectral magnitudes of _**both**_ human and chinchilla Envelope Following Responses (EFRs). The original purpose of these scripts was to investigate the ability of three auditory stimuli: Sinusoidal Amplitude Modulation (SAM), Square Envelope with 25% duty cycle (SQ25), and Square Envelope with 50% percent duty cycle (SQ50), to discriminate Synaptopathy from normal hearing. 

The mathematic equations that were used can be found in the appendix of a [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3724813/#c29) by Li Zhu, [Hari Bharadwaj](https://github.com/haribharadwaj), Jing Xia, and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham.

Human data pre-processing was done in [MNE](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) and also made use of functions found in the [ANLffr](https://github.com/SNAPsoftware/ANLffr) package.

## Pre-Processing

The data that can be loaded into the main script, `EFR_Processing.m`, must be in a *.mat* format. Chinchilla data from NEL should be directly compatible, so long as it is a *.mat*. 

However, data collected in a *.bdf* format must be passed through the python `bdf2mat.py` script found in the **MNE_code** subfolder, in order to be processed properly. 

`bdf2mat(froot,fs,Fs_new,hpf,t_stim,topchans,trial_name)` simply converts the *.bdf* into a *.mat* format that can be read by the main script, `EFR_Processing.m`. It also prints out multi-tapered PLV and Spectral Magnitudes of the averages of all trials (not truncated, but epoch'd). 


### **Example:**
```
trial_name = 'SQ25'    
froot = "C:\\Users\\racqu\\Documents\\Research\\Purdue\\HumanData\\AS\\"+trial_name+'\\'
fs = 16384
Fs_new = 4e3
hpf = 70
t_stim = [0.0,1.5] 
topchans = [31] 


bdf2mat(froot,fs,Fs_new,hpf,t_stim,topchans,trial_name)
```

`trial_name` - the name of the condition/stimulus you're testing

`froot` - root directory of all conditions

`fs` - sampling frequency (Hz) of your data

`hpf` - cutoff frequency for high pass filtering of the data

`t_stim` - the window you're interested in pulling the data for the *.mat* file from

`topchans` -  channel of interest (don't believe my code works with multiple channels yet)

## Using `EFR_Processing.m`

`EFR_Processing.m` is an implementation of multiple methods, detailed later. It allows the user to bootstrap data using a single subject, and also calculate means and standard deviations of summation of harmonic magnitudes and PLVs related to a particular fundamental frequency, F0.

### **Parameters**:

```
isHuman = 0; %MAKE SURE THIS IS 1 for Human or 0 for Chin

subject = "Q379";

bstraps = 1; %simulated number of "chins"
%t_array = [20,40,80,100,120,140];%number of trials conducted/polarity/subject. Make this an array if you want to test multiple N
t_array = 100;

%Sampling
Fs0_Human = 4e3; %if subject is Human
Fs0_Chin = round(48828.125); %if subject is a Chin

Fs = 4e3; %What you want to downsample to
F0 = 100; %Fundamental freq of interest in Hz

iterations = 100;
window = [0.1,1.3]; %Window of interest, truncated onset and break in stimulus
gain = 20e3; %Gain (doesn't really matter since looking at SNR & PLV, used for magnitude accuracy)
%gain = 1;

K_MRS = 100; %number of distributions to average spectra and PLVs over
K_NF = 10; %number of iterations to average noise floor distributions over (outer average)
I_NF = 100; %number of distributions to average noise floor over (inner average)

harmonics = 6; %How many harmonics to sum
```
### **Particular parameters of note:**
*The appendix of the paper helps understand some of these parameters.*

`bstraps` - how many times to run each element in `t_array` used to simulate multiple subjects and determine a minimum number of trials

`t_array` - how many trials you want to sample from your total dataset (randomly selected). 

**NOTE: for a given element in t_array, 1/5th of the trials are selected at a time for analysis. An average of `K_MRS` distributions of 1/5th of `t_array[i]` is calculated.**

`K_MRS`- how many distributions of a dataset with `t_array[i]` trials (400 in the paper)

`K_NF` and `I_NF`- how many iterations and distributions, respectively, of the spectral noise floor estimate to compute (1000 and 100 in paper, but 10 and 100 seemed to also be sufficient). **Significantly increases runtime.** 


### **Figures:**
The following figures were generated by `EFR_Processing.m`:

![Figure 1](Figures/PLV_MAG_Both.JPG)
*These are the spectral SNRs (Linear Scale) and PLVs computed for each of the 3 EFRs in response to the 3 stimuli. The peaks at the fundamental frequency (100 Hz) and it's first 5 harmonics were summed to quantify each response. A method for analysis has not yet been finalized, however the benefits of a PLV approach will be explained later.*


**WARNING: Uncommenting figure-related lines and running with `bstraps`>1 & `t_array` with length>1 will result in an abomination of figures.**


## Using `getDFT.m`

`getDFT` returns a frequency vector, the spectral SNR (mean DFT magnitude with noise floor subtracted), and PLV of a given set of trials. It is a function called by `EFR_Processing.m` and has sub-functions `getSpectMag.m` & `getNoiseFloor.m`.

### Example (from `EFR_Processing.m`):

```  
        [SAM_f,SAM_DFT,SAM_PLV] = getDFT(SAM_tot,trials,window,Fs,Fs0,gain,K_MRS,K_NF,I_NF);
```

***Output***

`SAM_f` - frequency vector

`SAM_DFT` - the mean spectral SNR vector

`PLV` - the mean PLV vector

***Input***

`SAM_tot` - cell array including all trials of interest. Even number indices represent positive polarity trials, odd indices are negative polarity trials.

`trials` - number of trials to sample (per polarity) from `SAM_tot`. 

`window` - window of interest (sec), i.e. `[0.1 , 1.3]`

`Fs` - sampling rate you wish to resample to (Hz)

`Fs0` - sampling rate of the trials in `SAM_tot`

`gain` - total gain (if no gain use 1) of any amplifiers used in data collection

`K_MRS`, `K_NF`, `I_NF` - See explanation in [**Using `EFR_Processing.m`**](#Using-`EFR_Processing.m`)

## Using `getSpectMag.m`

`getSpectMag.m` computes the DFT and calculates a mean SNR and PLV for a given set of trials. 

### Example (from `getDFT.m`):

```
    [f,MRS(i,:),PLV(i,:)] = getSpectMag(pos,neg,Fs,numtrials); 
```
